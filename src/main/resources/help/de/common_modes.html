  <p>Filius has three operating modes.</p>

  <h3>Design mode</h3>

  <p>In this mode, the various elements of the network can be assembled on the workspace.
     This mode is the one selected by default when starting Filius.</p>

  <p>To select this mode from one of the other two, use the F10 keyboard shortcut or
     click on the following button on the top bar:</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/design-mode.png"></div>
  
  <h3>Documentation mode</h3>
  
  <p>This mode allows you to add text boxes as well as rectangular blocks on the workspace.
     These elements do not influence the simulation but make it easier to read the network.</p>

  <p>To select this mode from one of the other two, use the F9 keyboard shortcut or
     click on the following button on the top bar:</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/doc-mode.png"></div> 

  <h3>Simulation mode</h3>
  
  <p>This mode is used to simulate network operation. The simulation includes the exchanges
     of data between the different elements that make up the network, as well as the
     interactions with the applications of the virtual stations of the network.</p>

  <p>To select this mode from one of the other two, use the F11 keyboard shortcut or
     click on the following button on the top bar:</p>
