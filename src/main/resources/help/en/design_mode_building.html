  <h2>General</h2>

  <p>Design mode allows you to build a computer network by assembling the different
     components on the workspace. It also allows you to configure certain parameters
     of these components.</p>

  <h3>Network construction</h3>

  <p>Using a drag-and-drop mouse, select components in the left margin and arrange 
     them on the workspace.</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/drag-node.gif"></div>
  
  <p>Holding the Alt (or Option) key while dragging and dropping a component 
     snaps it to the grid.</p>
     
  <p>To duplicate a station on the workspace, click on it to select it, then
     use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + D.</p>     

  <p>Connect the components with cables. To do this, select the cable tool by 
     clicking on the corresponding icon in the left margin,</p>
     
  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/cable.png"></div> 
     
  <p>or using the keyboard shortcut C, then click successively on the two components 
     to be connected.</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/connect-node.gif"></div>
  
  <p>To cancel the cable tool, use your choice: the keyboard shortcut C, the Esc key 
     on the keyboard, or a right click with the mouse.</p>
  
  <p>To delete a component or a cable, click on it, then press the Delete key on 
     the keyboard.</p>
     
  <p>To delete all the cables connected to a component, use its menu contextual 
     (right click).</p>  

  <h3>Network components settings</h3>

  <p>Each component has a set of parameters that can be defined using the control panel 
     located at the bottom of the window.</p>
     
  <p>To bring up the settings panel, double-click on a component or on a cable.</p>
     
  <p>When the settings panel is displayed, a single click on another component is used
     to display its parameters.</p>
     
  <p>The control panel closes when you click on an empty area of the workspace.</p>
  
  <p>When several stations or switches are selected, the number of modifiable parameters
     is reduced.</p>
     
  <p>For more information on the components, use the menu at the top of this window.</p>
