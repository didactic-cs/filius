  <p>In FILIUS, the Computer and Laptop components have identical functionality.
     Only their icons are different. Computers and laptops will be designated by 
     the generic term of station.</p>

  <p>Each station has an operating system, a desktop and applications which are 
     accessible in simulation mode.</p>

  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  
  <h4>Name</h4>
  
  <p>The name of a station can be chosen arbitrarily and it doesn't have any influence 
     on the functioning of the simulation.</p>
  
  <h4>Display IP address instead of the name</h4>
  
  <p>This option allows you to display the station's IP address under its icon instead
     of the name.</p>
  
  <h4>MAC address</h4>
  
  <p>This field contains the MAC address of the station. MAC addresses are randomly 
     generated by FILIUS at components creation.</p>
  
  <h4>DHCP service</h4>
  
  <p>The station can act as a DHCP server. For practical reasons, this service is 
     configured in design mode.</p>
     
  <p>The DHCP service assigns any workstation (other than the one on which it is 
     installed) an IP address and a subnet mask. It can optionally also provide 
     the IP address of a gateway and the IP address of a DNS server.</p>   
     
  <p>The current state of the DHCP service is displayed and the Configure button 
     provides access to the parameters of this service.</p>   
     
  <div class="center"><a href="design_mode_dhcp.html">DHCP service settings</a></div>

  <h4>IP address</h4>
  
  <p>Field used to enter the station's IP address. This field is required for the
     station to be able to access the network.</p>
  
  <h4>Netmask</h4>
  
  <p>Field used to enter the subnet mask of the station. This field is required for
     the station to be able to access the network.</p>
  
  <h4>Gateway</h4>
  
  <p>Field allowing the entry of the IP address of the router allowing to leave 
     the local network. This field is only necessary if the station needs to access 
     components located outside its local network.</p>
  
  <h4>Domain Name Server</h4>  
  
  <p>Field used to enter the IP address of a DNS server. This field is required only 
     if certain station applications use domain names (such as a web browser or an 
     email client, for example).</p>
     
  <h4>Use DHCP for configuration</h4>
  
  <p>Network settings can be obtained automatically from a DHCP server.</p>
     
  <p>In the event of automatic addressing, the station cannot act as a DHCP server.</p>
