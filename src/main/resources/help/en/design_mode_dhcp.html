  <h2>DHCP service</h2>  

  <p>The DHCP service assigns any station that requests it an IP address and 
     a subnet mask. It can optionally also provide the IP address of a gateway
     and the IP address of a DNS server.</p> 
     
  <h3>Setup</h3>  
  
  <h4>Start IP address / End IP address</h4>
  
  <p>These two IP addresses delimit the range of IP addresses which will be assigned 
     to the stations which will request them. These addresses must be in the same 
     subnet as the server.</p>

  <p>For network components whose IP addresses are not assigned automatically by a 
     DHCP server, it should be ensured that the addresses used are not within the
     range of addresses distributed by the server.</p>   
     
  <h4>Subnet mask</h4>  
  
  <p>This read-only field recalls the subnet mask of the server. It is also this 
     mask which is communicated to the clients at the same time as the requested 
     IP address.</p>
     
  <h4>Reserved addresses</h4>
  
  <p>This button provides access to the list of reserved IP addresses. These are 
     MAC address / IP address pairs allowing a specific IP address to be assigned
     to certain components which need to always have the same IP address.</p>

  <p>In the table, use the context menu (right click) on the rows to add, delete 
     or modify a pair of reserved addresses.</p>     
     
  <p>Reserved IP addresses must not lie within the range of automatically 
     distributed IP addresses. </p>   
  
  <h4>Gateway and DNS server</h4>
  
  <p>These two fields are used to define the IP address of a gateway as well as
     the IP address of a DNS server which will be communicated to client stations.</p>

  <h4>Identical to the server's parameters</h4>
  
  <p>When this box is checked, the server uses its own gateway and DNS server 
     settings rather than those defined above.</p>
  
  <h4>Activate the DHCP service</h4>  
  
  <p>By checking this box, the DHCP service is made active on this station.</p> 
  
  <p>Each time the simulation mode is activated, the stations configured as DHCP 
     clients will request a DHCP server to obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, 
     the IP address of a gateway and the IP address of a DNS server.</p>
