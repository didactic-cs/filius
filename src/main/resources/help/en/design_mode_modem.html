  <h2>Modem</h2>
  
  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/modem.png"></div> 

  <p>Modem components work in pairs. They make it possible to establish a link between two
     disjoint networks. The two connected networks are then part of the same sub-network; 
     the same IP address cannot therefore be used simultaneously in both.</p>
 
  <p>The two networks connected by the modems can be found in the same FILIUS project,
     but also in separate projects executed on separate (real) computers.</p>   
     
  <p>To establish the connection between two modems, one must be configured as a server
     and the other as a client. This choice has no impact on the exchanges between them 
     once the connection is established.</p>      
     
  <h3>Settings</h3>

  <h4>Name</h4>

  <p>The name of a modem can be chosen arbitrarily and it has no influence on the operation
     of the simulation.</p>

  <h4>Port</h4>

  <p>This field allows you to specify a port number that is used when this modem is in 
     server mode.</p>

  <h4>Wait for incoming connection request</h4>

  <p>By checking this box, the modem switches to server mode and waits for a connection 
     from a client modem. An orange dot on its icon indicates that it is waiting for 
     connection.</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/modem_waiting.png"></div> 
     
  <p>A server modem can only be connected to one client modem and vice versa.</p>
  
  <p>A modem cannot be both a client and a server.</p>

  <h4>IP adresse of the remote modem</h4>

  <p>This field allows you to specify the (real) IP address of the computer on which
     the (virtual) server modem is running in FILIUS. If the server modem is in the 
     same project as the current modem, you can enter <b>localhost</b> as the IP address.</p>

  <h4>Port of the remote modem</h4>
  
  <p>This field allows you to specify the port number of the server modem to contact.</p>

  <h4>Connect/Disconnect</h4>

  <p>This button is used to establish the connection with the server modem. Once the 
     connection is established, the icons of the two modems show a green dot.</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/modem_connected.png"></div> 
     
  <p>This button is also used to terminate a connection, both from the client and 
     from the server.</p>
