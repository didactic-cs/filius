  <h2>Project</h2> 

  <p>FILIUS saves all the components and their configuration in a project file.
     These files have the extension .fls.</p>

  <h4>The saved items are:</h4>
  
  <p>The components, their positions, the cables that connect them, their parameters, and, 
     in the case of workstations, the applications installed as well as the files and folders 
     of the workstation's operating system. Structural blocks and texts added in documentation
     mode are also saved.</p>
     
  <h4>The unsaved items are:</h4>
  
  <p>The SAT table of switches and the contents of the data tracking window.</p>   

  <h3>Open and save a project </h3>
  
  <p>Opening and saving a project can be done from design and documentation modes only.

  <h3>Export as image</h3>  
   
  <p>The project diagram can be exported as a raster image in PNG format or as a vector image
     in SVG format. To do this, click on the black arrow on the save button.</p>

  <h3>Create a report</h3>  
   
  <p>A project status report can be generated in PDF format. This report consists of the project
     diagram, the configuration of the components, including the applications installed in the 
     case of workstations and, where applicable, the content of the data tracking window.</p>
