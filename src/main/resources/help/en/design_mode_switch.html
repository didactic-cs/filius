  <h2>Switch</h2> 
  
  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/switch.png"></div> 
     
  <p>The Switch component allows multiple components to be interconnected within the same local area
     network. Its function is to circulate datagrams using the MAC addresses of components on the 
     local network. A switch does not use IP addresses.</p>
     
  <p>Each FILIUS switch has 24 ports which allow the connection of as many components, including 
     other switches.</p>
     
  <h3>Settings</h3>
  
  <h4>Name</h4> 
  
  <p>The name can be used to differentiate multiple switches, but separate switches can also have 
     the same name. This name has no effect on the simulation.</p>  
  
  <h4>Display as cloud</h4> 
  
  <p>This option allows you to change the appearance of the switch on the workspace. It has no
     effect whatsoever on the simulation.</p>
