  <h2>General</h2>
  
  <p>This mode allows you to add visual elements that make the network easier to read.
     These elements do not have any influence on the simulation.</p>

  <p>In documentation mode, structure fields and text areas are displayed in front of
     the network components to facilitate their positioning. In other modes, they pass
     behind the components.</p>

  <h3>Structure field</h3>

  <p>Using a drag-and-drop with the mouse, select the structure field in the left 
     margin and drop it on the workspace.</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/structure-block.png"></div>	

  <p>Then move or resize this block using the mouse.</p>

  <p>To duplicate a field, click on it to select it, then use the keyboard 
     shortcut Ctrl + D.</p>
  
  <p>To delete a block, click on it, then press the Delete key on the keyboard.</p>

  <p>Use the contextual menu of the field (right click) to modify its color.</p>

  <p>The stacking order of the fields can be changed using the context menu.
     This can be useful when two fields overlap.</p>

  <h3>Text areas</h3>
	
  <p>Using a drag-and-drop with the mouse, select the text area in the left margin
     and drop it on the workspace.</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="help/gfx/text-area.png"></div>

  <p>When a text area is selected, it is surrounded by a blue frame. Otherwise, a
     simple gray outline delimits the area.</p> 

  <p>To modify the text area, click on it. The text can then be edited directly.</p> 

  <p>Use the blue frame to move or resize the text area.</p>

  <p>To duplicate a text box, click on it to select it, then use the keyboard shortcut
     Ctrl + D.</p>

  <p>To delete the text box, click on it to select it, then use the keyboard shortcut
     Ctrl + Delete.</p>

  <p>Use the context menu to change the font color, size and style of characters. </p>

  <p>If necessary, it is possible to change the stacking order of the text areas using
     the context menu. Note that the text areas are always displayed in front of the 
     structure fields.</p>
