  <h2>Network commands</h2>
  
  <h3>ipconfig</h3>
	
  <p>This command displays the configuration of the network interface.</p>
  
  <h3>netstat</h3>
	
  <p>This command displays information about network connections.</p>
  
  <h3>arp</h3>
  
  <p>The station's ARP cache is a table containing ARP entries. Each of
     these entries is a pair made up of an IP address and the corresponding
     MAC address. The ARP cache is used to speed up the resolution of IP
     addresses to MAC addresses.</p>
  
  <p>Used without a parameter, or with the -a parameter alone, the arp
     command displays the contents of the ARP cache. Example of use:<br>
     arp -a 192.168.0.10</p>
     
  <p>Used with the -a parameter followed by an IP address, the arp command
     displays only the entry associated with that address. Example of use:<br>
     arp -d 192.168.0.10</p>
     
  <p>Used with the -d parameter followed by an IP address, the arp command
     removes the entry associated with that address from the cache. Example
     of use:<br>
     arp -d *</p>
     
  <p>Used with the -d parameter followed by the * character, the arp command
     clears all cache entries.</p>
  
  <p>The cache is also cleared each time the simulation is started.</p>
  
  <h3>arpsend&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="param">fictitious-ip</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="param">destination-ip</span></h3>
  
  <p>This command sends to a destination station a correspondence between
     the MAC address of the station on which the command is entered and
     any IP address. This correspondence will be added to the recipient's ARP table.</p>
  
  <p>This command can be used for testing purposes.</p>
  
  <h3>host&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="param">hostname</span></h3>
	
  <p>This command resolves a hostname to an IP address.</p>
  
  <p>The <span class="param">hostname</span> parameter corresponds to the 
     name of the computer whose IP address is sought.</p>
  
  <h3>nslookup&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="param">hostname</span></h3>
	
  <p>This command resolves a host name to an IP address. It also specifies
     the address of the server performing the resolution.</p>
  
  <p>The <span class="param">hostname</span> parameter corresponds to the 
     name of the computer whose IP address is sought.</p>
  
  <h3>route</h3>
	
  <p>This command displays the routing table of the station.</p>
  
  <h3>ping&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="param">ip-address | hostname</span></h3>
	
  <p>This command tests the network connection with another station.</p>
  
  <p>The parameter <span class="param">ip-address | hostname</span> can be
     either the IP address or the name of the other station.</p>
     
  <h3>traceroute&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="param">ip-address | hostname</span></h3>
	
  <p>This command lists the jumps required to reach a position.</p>
  
  <p>The <span class="param">ip-address | hostname</span> can be
     either the IP address or the name of the station to be reached.</p>
  
  <h3>tcpdump</h3>
	
  <p>This command is used to monitor the network traffic by displaying each of
     the Ethernet frames entering or leaving the station.</p>
     
  <p>It displays the same information as the data tracking window.</p>
  
  <p>To interrupt this command, enter Ctrl+C.</p>
